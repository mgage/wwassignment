## Active development of this Moodle module has moved to wwassignment on https://github.com/openwebwork
## Moodle WeBWorK assignment activity module

**wwassignment** and **wwlink** provide a reliable method of presenting introductory and 
advanced mathematics assignments through the Moodle LMS.  They replace the "wwmoodle" repository.

The modules are written in php and added to the Moodle installation in the directories
moodle/mods (for wwassignment) and moodle/blocks (for wwlink).  These modules are compatible
with Moodle 1.9.8+ and Moodle 2.x.y.

This repository contains a branch that works with Moodle 1.9.8, the last of the Moodle 1.x versions, 
as well as a branch that works with  Moodle 2.8.x versions including at this writing version 2.8.5.  

The original version of this software "wwmoodle" was written by Peter Snoblin at Truman State University
in 2005 to connect WeBWorK1 and Moodle 1.  Additional development during 2006 and 2007 
by Michael Gage and then by Matt Leventi at the University of Rochester 
produced a robust connection between evolving versions of Moodle1 and WeBWorK2. 

Jonathan Duncan at Walla Walla University made modifications which allowed 
these modules to continue to work with Moodle 2.0.
(This is essentially the ver2.6+ branch of this repository.) 

Most recently (2014-2015) Michael Gage with help from  Nelson Moller (Cégep à Distance) have overhauled the 
modules, removing spurious error messages, modifying the backup code and 
making adjustments so that these modules now work well with the latest version of Moodle 2.8.5.
The original "wwmoodle" repository has been split into "wwassignment" and "wwlink" so 
that they are easier to install.

Quick install **wwlink**:

1. cd moodle/blocks
2. git clone https://github.com/openwebwork/wwassignment.git

Quick install **wwassignment**:

1. cd moodle/mod
2. git clone https://github.com/openwebwork/wwlink.git

For most installations you will want to use the default branch which is ver2.8+

A moodle administrator will need to log in to Moodle from the web in order to activate the two modules and 
to configure the wwassignment preferences so that it points to a local webwork server. 

No changes need to be made to WeBWorK except for uncommenting certain lines in the configuration file.

For more details see the file "INSTALL and CONFIGURE" which also 
describes how to enable the WeBWorK webservice at the WeBWorK installation.

Finally there is much expertise and support for using Moodle and WeBWorK together on the 
forum.
